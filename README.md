# heuristics
Different heuristic algorithms solving TSP. What ist TSP about you can find elsewhere.
The plan is to implement simulated annealing first and look what happens. The bad guy is a TSP with a trivial solution e.g. all cities located on a circle. I really want to know how heuristic algorithms fail (or maybe not). The next algorithm to implement is at the time being unknown, there are many of them. Certainly one day Tabu Search will appear here: I have it in C++ but this project is about Python, stay tuned.
